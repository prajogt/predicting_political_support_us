abstract: "Using data gathered from the 2022 Cooperative Election Study (CES), we navigate through the various possible factors that influence a US citizen's voting decision. By examining a representative sample of 60 000 Americans, we can discern patterns in beliefs and personal backgroundsâ€”ranging from gun control and student loan stances to race, religion, and educational background. This paper discusses the impact these individual factors may have towards predicting a voter's alignment, as well as how multiple factors can coalign to portray a more substantial impact. We aim to highlight these correlations and their potential implications with future elections."
